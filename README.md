# KnTest

Test Task1: Add book (expected code is set for 400) because otherwise the test fails as the same book cannot be added twice.
Login is not neccessary during post and delete methods (added basic token in the header)

Test Task2: added book and deleted the same book

Tests can be launched with run (green arrow)

To see report: 

1) need to generate report by using gradle report function (right side of the intelij where all gradle tasks are)
2) next step to use gradle serve function in the same location - html page will open with allure report on it.
